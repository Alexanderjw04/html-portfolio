<h1>The Best Movies According to Alexus</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>A Space Odyssey (1968)</h3>
<p>The greatest film ever made began with the meeting of two brilliant minds: Stanley Kubrick and sci-fi seer Arthur C Clarke.</p>

<h3>The Godfather (1972)</h3>
<p>From the wise guys of Goodfellas to The Sopranos, all crime dynasties that came after The Godfather are descendants of the Corleones</p>

<h3>Citizen Kane (1941)</h3>
<p>The source book of Orson Welles, and still a marvellous movie. Thematically less resonant than some of Welles' later meditations on the nature of power</p>
